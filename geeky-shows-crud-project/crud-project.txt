# urlencoded() => 

express.urlencoded(options) => This is a built-in middleware funciton in Express. It parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser.

This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the  (i.e req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.

This object will contain key-value pairs, where the value can be a string or array (when extended is false), or any type (when extended is true)

type: This is used to determine what media type the middleware will parse.

express.urlencoded({
    type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
})

extended => This option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when false) or the qs library (when true)
