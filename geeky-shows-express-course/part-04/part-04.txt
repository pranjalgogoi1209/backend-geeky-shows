# EXPRESS APPLICATION GENERATOR
Use the application generator tool, express-generator, to quickly create an application skeleton.

To install the app =>
npx express-generator --view=ejs app_name

To global install =>
npm install -g express-generator
express --view=ejs app_name

To install node modules =>
npm install

To run the app =>
SET DEBUG=app_name:* & npm start

# ALL FILES INSIDE THE APP =>

* app_name => Application / Project folder

* bin => The bin folder contains the executable file that starts your app. It starts the server (on port 3000, if no alternative is supplied) and sets up some basic error handling.

* public => Everything in the folder is accessible to people connecting to application. We can put javascript, css, images and othe assets.

* routes => we can put all our route files, The generator creates two files, index.js and users.js.

* views => The views folder is where we have files used by your templating engine.

* app.js file => This file creates an express application object (named app, by convention), sets up the application with various settings and middleware, and then exports the app from the module.
