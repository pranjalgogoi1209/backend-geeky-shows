# ROUTE PARAMETER =>

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL.

The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

The name of route parameters must be made up of "word characters" ([A-Za-z0-9]).

Eg:-
/student/:id    
//www.example.com/student/12

/product/:category/:id  
//www.example.com/product/mobile/23

/product/order/:year/and/:month
//www.example.com/train/ranchi-dhanbad

/train/:from-:to
//www.example.com/train/ranchi-dhanbad

/location/:state.:city
//www.example.com/location/jh.ranchi

req.params = {
    "state": "jh", 
    "city": "ranchi",
}

# ROUTE PARAMETER WITH REGX =>
To have more control over the exact string that can be matched by a route parameter, you can append a regular experssion in parentheses (()).

eg:-
/student/:id([0-9]{2})
//www.example.com/student/12

/product/order/:year/and/:month([a-z])
//www.example.com/product/order/2018/and/feb
