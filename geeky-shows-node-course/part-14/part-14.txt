# URL =>

The url module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

const url = require("url");
import url from "url";

const myUrl = new URL ("https://www.exaample.com: 8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash");

hash => Gets and sets the fragment portion of the URL.

host => Gets and sets the host portion of the URL.

hostname => Gets and sets the host name portion of the URL. The key difference between url.host and url.hostname is that url.hostname does not include the port.

pathname => Gets and sets the path portion of the URL.

port => Gets and sets the port portion of the URL.

protocol => Gets and sets the protocol of the URL.

search => Gets and sets the serialized query portion of the URL.

toString() => The toString() method on the URL object returns the serialized URL. The value returned is equivalent to that of url.href and url.toJSON().

toJSON() => The toJSON() method on the URL object returns the serialized URL. The value returned is equivalent to that of url.href and url.toString().
